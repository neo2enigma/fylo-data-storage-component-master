## My process
First I tried to understand each part of design and group them as possible. creating cards with exact margin and padding was a little tricky. Finally in desktop version I used 2 media query to make it desktop friendly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Mobile-First design is a correct approach for a front-end developer. It will help to make the design for desktop with a few css properties.
